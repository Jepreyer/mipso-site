      <div class="col-md-6"<p>Chapel Hill’s indie Americana quartet Mipso – Jacob Sharp (mandolin, vocals), Wood Robinson (bass, vocals), Joseph Terrell (guitar, vocals), and Libby Rodenbough (fiddle, vocals) – release their fifth album, Edges Run, on April 6th, 2018 via a newly inked record deal with AntiFragile Music. Influenced by the contradiction of its progressive home and the surrounding rural southern landscapes, Mipso has been hailed as “hewing surprisingly close to gospel and folk while still sounding modern and secular” (Acoustic Guitar) and was recently recognized by Rolling Stone as an “ Artist You Need to Know.” The band brings a distinctly unique sound – full of wistful beauty, hopeful undercurrents, and panoramic soundscapes.</p>
      <p>Venturing ever-further from its string-band pedigree to discover a broader Americana where classic folk-rock and modern alt-country sounds mingle easily with Appalachian tradition, Mipso’s music is lush and forward moving, with lyrics that sear and salve in turn.  Look for Mipso on tour this spring in support of their new release, Edges Run.</p>

          <h1>WHAT THE HECK IS A 'MIPSO'?</h1>
            <p>Our name is inspired by our first tour after college in Japan, where we performed at the 43rd annual Takarazuka Bluegrass Festival and a concert at Tokyo's historic country music venue, Rocky Top. In Japanese, there is a phrase that means something familiar, but there's something a little bit off. This roughly translates, or at least so we were told, to 'a little pee in the miso.' Since the meaning of the phrase resonated with our cross-genre music, we decided to put a little P in the miso…and voila, Mipso!</p>
